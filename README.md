# Git-Hero - Aparoksha 24

Welcome to Git-Hero, an event conducted under Aparoksha 24, designed to showcase your Git skills through a series of exciting challenges. Whether you're a seasoned Git expert or just getting started, Git-Hero offers a platform for you to demonstrate your proficiency, learn new techniques, and compete with other participants.

## How It Works

Git-Hero presents participants with a series of challenges that test their understanding and mastery of Git concepts and commands. Challenges may include tasks such as resolving merge conflicts, branching strategies, rebasing, working with remote repositories, and more. Each challenge is designed to simulate real-world scenarios commonly encountered in software development projects.

Participants can access the challenges through the Git-Hero platform, where they will find detailed instructions and guidelines for completing each task. Upon completing a challenge, participants can submit their solutions for evaluation.
