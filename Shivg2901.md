Cultural sensitivity
The computer industry's use of the terms master and slave caught everyone's attention in the summer of 2020. Amid the many protests and the growing social unrest, these harmful and antiquated terms were no longer considered appropriate.

"Both Conservancy and the Git project are aware that the initial branch name, 'master,' is offensive to some people and we empathize with those hurt by the use of that term," said the Software Freedom Conservancy.

GitHub took action based on the Conservancy's suggestion and moved away from the term master when a Git repository is initialized, "We support and encourage projects to switch to branch names that are meaningful and inclusive, and we'll be adding features to Git to make it even easier to use a different default for new projects." As a result, GitHub renamed the master branch to main branch.

The change isn't retroactive and won't affect any existing projects. Also, if GitHub users want to add a branch named master to their repository, there is nothing to stop them. GitHub only discourages the term -- it does not ban the term

For Whitney Sorenson, chief architect at HubSpot in Cambridge, Mass., the benefits of GitHub renaming the master branch to main far outweigh any temporary stumbling blocks. He said the change is part of a broader internal initiative to add inclusive language to the company's systems. His team is also replacing whitelist and blacklist with allowlist and blocklist.

"While it takes time to make these changes now, it's a one-time engineering cost that will have lasting impacts, both internally and externally," Sorenson said in an email. "We're in this for the long game, and we know inclusive language is just as much about how we code and what we build as it is about person-to-person interactions."
